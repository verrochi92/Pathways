# Pathways
2-player maze game prototype. Available in a text-based C++ version and a JavaFX gui application

Originally intended for a physical board, here is a software-based prototype of how
the game will work. One player plots a path from one side of the grid to another,
while the other then tries to navigate the proper path with a set number of tries.

The text-based version has code that could be used as a base for other games that
use grid-based movement, such as a text-based adventure or RPG. 

The JavaFX version is closer to what the physical game would be like, as it is much
more visual and you can get a better picture of how the board would look.
